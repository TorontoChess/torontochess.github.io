The Greater Toronto Chess League (GTCL) is the governing body of chess in Toronto. The Executives are elected annually to support the development of chess across the Greater Toronto Area. It is supported by the Ontario Chess Association (OCA), and the Canadian Chess Federation (CFC). The CFC works closely with the International Chess Federation (FIDE). 

Some of the functions of the GTCL include: 
- conducting annual Toronto tournaments such as the Toronto Open, Toronto Closed, Toronto Rapid, and Toronto Blitz Chess Championships
- supporting the development of new clubs
- assisting new players in the region 
- coordinating with provincial, federal and international chess governing bodies 
- encouraging top chess tournaments in Canada and globally to be hosted in Toronto

## **Current Site**
The GTCL maintains the following site: https://www.torontochess.org/. 

## **Goals and Motivations**
In the coming year, this site will work towards: 
- Develop a GTCL website that aggregates upcoming chess events in the Toronto area, sourced from the CFC database.
- Include on this website an interactive map featuring local community clubs, complete with locations, details, pictures, and hours of operation.

This initiative can be implemented with an estimated annual cost of $100 to cover server, domain, and basic development expenses. 

## **Why we need a new site?**
- A recurring concern has been the number of Torontonians who actively play online but have never attended an in-person chess event. A strong and consistent communication effort is vital in addressing this, and in elevating the public image of Torontoâ€™s chess community.
- Many chess players in Toronto want to get involved but don't know how. They often will turn to CFC's database but that oftentimes lacks resources and information. Or the information is too centric to Canada/Ontario.
- The data on the old site lacks images, videos, and content which many students, young adults, and youth would prefer. This site will include images, a modern UI, and interaction.
- Analytics can be better tracked (e.g. site hits) to provide a metric for success of chess development efforts

## **Who is Involved**
The current lead for this project is Victor Zheng, the former Chair of the Hart House Chess Club at the University of Toronto. He was elected in the 2025-2026 GTCL Board on a mandate to work on a re-design of the website for the Greater Toronto Chess League. 

## **Contribute**
We are looking for motivated people to support the development of this site.
